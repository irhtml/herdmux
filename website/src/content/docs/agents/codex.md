description: What the sidebar shows for Codex panes, and what is not available due to the Codex hook schema.
---

Codex exposes a smaller hook set than Claude Code, so some sidebar features are not available.

## What you get

### Status and prompts

- Live status from `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` / `Stop`
- `waiting` with a `permission_prompt` wait reason from `PermissionRequest`. The hook prints nothing, so Codex still shows its own approval prompt
- Interrupted turns (`Esc`) return to `idle` via `Interrupt`, since Codex sends no `Stop` for them
- Pane cleanup on exit via `SessionEnd`
- Prompt text from `UserPromptSubmit`
- Response preview (`▷ …`) from `Stop`
- Elapsed time since the last prompt

### Git

- Branch display from the pane's `cwd`
- PR number (needs `gh` CLI)

### Permission badges

- `auto` and `!` — inferred from process arguments
- `plan` / `edit` are **not** available on Codex

### Notifications

- `stop`: fires when the assistant finishes responding.
- `notification`: fires when Codex asks for approval (`PermissionRequest`).

### Activity log

- `Bash` tool calls only. Codex's `PostToolUse` fires only for `Bash` (its `tool_input` is schema-typed as `{ command: string }`), so `Read` / `Edit` / `Write` / `Grep` / `Glob` and every other tool is not reported.

## What is not available

| Feature                                   | Why                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wait reasons other than permission prompts | Needs `Notification`, `PermissionDenied`, `TeammateIdle` (Claude-only) |
| Background shell state                    | Codex's Bash hook payload is schema-typed as `{ command: string }` and does not include a background flag |
| API failure reason                        | Needs `StopFailure` (Claude-only)                                    |
| Task progress counter                     | Needs non-Bash `PostToolUse` coverage                                |
| Sub-agent tree                            | Needs `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop`                               |
| Worktree lifecycle tracking               | Needs `WorktreeCreate` / `WorktreeRemove`                            |
| `task_completed` / `stop_failure` / `permission_denied` notifications | Those hooks don't exist in Codex                                     |

**Waiting status**: after you approve a permission prompt, the status stays `waiting` until the approved tool finishes and its `PostToolUse` fires.

## Setup

Wire the hooks from inside a Codex pane — see [Codex setup](/herdmux/getting-started/codex/).
